      <description>VRParty.social ðŸ¥½ VRParty is a VR-focused Mastodon instance, Mastodon is an open-source federated micro-blogging platform with a similar feel to Twitter. Learn more about Mastodon on their official website joinmastodon.org.
The instance is focused on VR but non-vr related content is allowed.
You can follow @Reno, the owner, for instance updates and information or @vrparty.
Why? Why make VRParty? My reason for making VRP is that I noticed that there are not many VR-focused instances that exist on the Fediverse, and the ones that do exist are mostly dead and catered to AR or MR with the exception of the Baka.</description>
